# Wolf-Hunt
A small game coded in C++ where you kill wolves and get better attacks from the number of wolves you kill.
Upcoming updates: {
After you hit a certain amount of wolves you killed, it will give you a weapon to fight easier with.
Along the way, there will be health potions you can obtain and consume.
}
This game is very primitive as of now. It is ran inside of a console. There will probably be some huge changes later on.
But that's nowhere near anytime soon. I am a beginner at C++ and when and if I get better, there will probably be lots of dramatic
changes to the game. I know the game is nowhere near fun but it is not designed to be. It is simply just practice for my coding.
If you run into any bugs or features you want me to implament, hit me up on the issues tab.
